   * Working in a team of four graduate students/post-docs to expand a machine-learning based model to predict adverse police-citizen incidents.
   * Part of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship in Chicago, IL.

   * Modeling of shoaling nonlinear internal waves over a shallow, sloping bathymetry.
   * A fortran90/Matlab suite of tools to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a high-order element-based discretization and a Schur-complement based domain decomposition.  Under development with Greg Thomsen and Peter Diamessis.

   * Use of deflation alongside block-diagonal preconditioning for designing a parallel sparse matrix solver for elliptic FEM problems.
   * Acheives convergence rate of GMRES independent of grid deformations and grid size.
